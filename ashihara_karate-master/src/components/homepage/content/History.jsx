After he left school at the age of 16 went to Tokyo to find a job but was interested in doing some exercises. He was interested in learning Karate and one day saw a poster about Karate classes. This led him to Oyama Dojo in Ikebukuro. He joined then and there and started to learn Karate every day. He at the first grading test after nine months was awarded the green belt and progressed soon to brown belt and then after three and a half years was awarded the Sho Dan grade at the age of 19. After two more years in 1966 he was made an instructor of Oyama Dojo which soon changed the name to Kokusai Karate Do Kyokushin Kai Kan and has just built a new dojo near the Ikebukuro station.&nbsp;</span></p>

He was to go to Brazil as an instructor, but he decided to spread the art in Nomura. As the town was too small to spread karate, he decided to move to Uwa-jima. However as this was situated too far to the south, he decided to find a dojo to train in Yawathahama. He started training his students at the Police training facility. Initially he had 55 members for training. After an encounter at the dojo with a student weighing 100Kg and knocking him down with a right Mawaeshi geri to his left chin, he worked out a way of handling heavier opponents and also the way in handling a few attackers at the same time in a brawl. While they trained in the dojo, Shihan Ashihara began to develop his own technique to full fill the above requirement easily, the foundation of SABAKI which later became his life work. This was based on three main points, the four lines, maai and positioning. He went deep into this principle and came up with the Sabaki method.</span></p>

This dojo is being taken care of by Shihan Noriyoshi Nakamoto. Shihan Ashihara moved to Matsuyama and prepared the groundwork to build a new dojo in Matsuyama City on the advice of Master Shohei Mori. Shihan Ashihara and his newly married wife moved to a rented out flat. Shihan Ashihara put up posters to announce that a Karate Instructor has arrived in Matsuyama City. Initially he had only ten members. At the same time, he received an invitation to train the young lions at the Police training school. The Sabaki method matured and got established at this police academy. More and more people joined from the police, Ehime university, Matsuyama university, Medical College and other institutions. The popularity of his teaching and the new style spread so far and wide that the numbers swelled beyond three hundred, He was invited to train in other dojo in the mainland going even beyond Hiroshima.&nbsp;</span></p>

Master Shohei Mori too helped Shihan Ashihara in this project. The construction of the dojo commenced in March 1978 and the opening took place in 1979.</span></p>

The other branch chiefs complained of their students attending training classes conducted by Ashihara Shihan. Kancho Oyama saw this investment as a waste of money. He demanded more money to be sent to the headquarters as membership fees. Shihan Ashihara at the end of the conference made an announcement that he would resign from the organization within twelve months. However, after a few months Shihan Ashihara received a letter informing him that he is permanently expelled from the organization. &nbsp;</span></p>

He could not let down the many students he had which numbered over three hundred and fifty. He decided to form his own organization. &nbsp;He named it as, Shin Kokusai Karate Do Renmei Ashihara Kai Kan. Soon, there were many dojo established, with some dojo as far as Ibaraki in the main island. Before long quite a few branches were established outside Japan and this organization in Sri Lanka is the second one to be established outside Japan, the branch in Australia being the first.&nbsp;</span></p>

As Karate became popular more dojo had to be established in most parts of the island to quench the thirst of young enthusiasts. In 1975 Sensei Weilgama represented Sri Sri Lanka with a team of four members at the First World Open Karate Tournament in Japan.
