# ONLINE SHOPPING CART SYSTEM FOR A FASHION STORE 


The ultimate project concept is to handle three device users; the admin, customer, and store manager where they are allowed to execute the system's normal CRUD operations. Besides those, we can add permission and necessary protection features to the framework.

From what we discussed, these roles are split into four key functionalities according to the three user positions provided; customer, admin, and store manager. They are as follows:

## User Management System 
###### o	Client 
where user can register into our system. View the items available, purchase or add those items into the cart. The user can also maintain a profile on themselves. They can also send feedbacks to the admin regarding their thoughts and complaints. Users can also edit their details and delete their account if they want to.

###### o	Admin 
The admin can log into the admin panel and view all the available customers who have been registered into the system. The admin has the capability to delete a customer but an email will be sent with the reason attached. We thought of adding that functionality because some users may not be appropriate to be as a customer. The admin can view the feedbacks given by the customers/users. Also the total amount of users in the system per each month is displayed as a bar chart so that admin can get a clear idea about the customer interest growth rate.

## Stock Management System
###### Admin
Stock Management function is responsible to add supplier's and stock details to the system.First admin can register suppliers though filling the relavant form.According to the specific supplier can add their stock details to the system. When changing the selling price and the quantity of the stock simultaneously update the item colour table.The admin can update,delete suppliers' details and stock details.
